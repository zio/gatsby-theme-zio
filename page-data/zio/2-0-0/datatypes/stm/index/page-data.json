It doesn't require us to think about low-level primitives. It doesn't force us to think about the ordering of locks. Reasoning concurrent program in a declarative fashion is very simple. We can just focus on the logic of our program and run it in a concurrent environment deterministically. The user code is much simpler of course because it doesn't have to deal with the concurrency at all. \")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Optimistic Concurrency\"), \" \\u2014 In most cases, we are allowed to be optimistic, unless there is tremendous contention.

We would like to have the ease of use of coarse-grain locking, but at the same time, we would like to have the efficiency of fine-grain locking. ZIO provides several data types which are a very coarse way of using concurrency, but they are implemented as if every single word were lockable. So the granularity of concurrency is fine-grained. It increases the performance and concurrency. For example, if we have two fibers accessing the same \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"TArray\"), \", one of them read and write on the first index of our array, and another one is read and write to the second index of that array, they will not conflict.
