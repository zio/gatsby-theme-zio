Yet, the question remains: can you develop a web service using ZIO libraries alone? In this talk, we'll explore the answer to this question directly. We'll start by creating an SMTP server using ZIO NIO, and then we'll add a frontend based on ZIO gRPC and Scala.js. Along the way, we'll leverage ZIO Config to externalize the configuration, as well as the ZLayer mechanism for dependency injection. Maybe we'll throw ZIO JSON into the mix, and at the end, we'll take a step back to appreciate how much is really possible gluing those ZIO components together!
