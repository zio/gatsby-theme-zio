De Goes and Adam Fraser introduce a new Scala library with a completely different factoring of functional type classes\\u2014one which throws literally everything away and starts from a clean slate. In this new factoring, type classes leverage Scala\\u2019s strengths, including variance and modularity. Pieces fit together cleanly and uniformly, and in a way that satisfies existing use cases, but enables new ones never before possible.

In object-oriented programming, classes and interfaces help us with abstraction to reduce boilerplate. But, in functional programming, we use type classes. Historically, type classes in functional programming have been very complex and confusing, partially because they import ideas from Haskell that don't make sense in Scala, and partially because of their esoteric origins in category theory. In this presentation, Jorge V\\xE1squez presents a new library called ZIO Prelude, which offers a distinctly Scala take on Functional Abstractions, and you will learn how you can eliminate common types of boilerplate by using it.
