We'll start by creating an SMTP server using ZIO NIO, and then we'll add a frontend based on ZIO gRPC and Scala.js. Along the way, we'll leverage ZIO Config to externalize the configuration, as well as the ZLayer mechanism for dependency injection. Maybe we'll throw ZIO JSON into the mix, and at the end, we'll take a step back to appreciate how much is really possible gluing those ZIO components together!

In object-oriented programming, classes and interfaces help us with abstraction to reduce boilerplate. But, in functional programming, we use type classes. Historically, type classes in functional programming have been very complex and confusing, partially because they import ideas from Haskell that don't make sense in Scala, and partially because of their esoteric origins in category theory.

Yet, using local parallelism, it is possible to dramatically improve the performance of ML projects\\u2014for example, by fetching data sources in parallel. Historically, Scala projects have used Scala's Future for local parallelism, but increasingly, many projects have begun adopting ZIO as a better Future. Although powerful, ZIO is not easy to set up with Spark. In this talk, Leo will introduce an open-source library that handles all boilerplate so you can easily implement Spark and ZIO in your ML projects, and will then present detailed benchmarks showing how much additional performance can be obtained through local parallelism.
